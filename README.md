# Picky Adventurer

Did you accidentally delete a scene, change the wrong actor, or edit a journal you shouldn't have? Does the sound of re-importing the entire Adventure scare you? Would you rather import the one or two things you need fixing? Then you're a Picky Adventurer!

In all seriousness, the Picky Adventurer module lets you pick just the things you want to import from an Adventure rather than the entire thing. This way you can get back that missing scene without updating all the actors that you've customized. After you start the import process on the Adventure, this module will show a window where you can select what documents to create or update. After you pick what you want to import, the module will filter the documents to import so you can create or update only what you want.
